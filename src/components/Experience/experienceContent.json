        "As a software developer I am most proud of <a class='content-link' href='https://github.com/damonpickett/macta' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>MacTA</a> (Macintosh Terminal Assistant). MacTA is a command-line application that I built using JavaScript and OpenAI’s API. By calling MacTA the user is prompted to describe a task they’d like to complete within their terminal. MacTA uses OpenAI’s API to produce clear, concise instructions for completing terminal tasks without having to leave the terminal. In building MacTA I also gained experience in putting together an NPM package which has been downloaded hundreds of times to date.",
        "I’m also extremely proud of <a class='content-link' href='https://github.com/damonpickett/buge' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>buge</a>, for the same reasons above with one exception: I built it with Python and packaged it for PyPI. buge is a command-line application that explains error codes and offers solutions. From this experience I learned that while JavaScript (React) is great for front-end, I prefer to use Python for pure logic-based programming.",
        "In 2022 I designed and built a website for a client. The purpose of the site was to convert users into renting an events centre through AirBnB. The space is called <a class='content-link' href='https://blackbrooklodge.ca/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Black Brook Lodge</a> and since the website launched Black Brook Lodge has received steady bookings. The experience of this project was extremely gratifying. I had doubts about my ability to build a website that converts, but I did my homework, stuck to the script, and it paid off. It turns out conventions are conventions for a reason.",
        "Building this site, the one you’re currently on, has been an awesome experience as well. Of all my work, this site is easily the most visually appealing. I’d built three portfolio sites for myself previously. In each case, I knew it wasn’t going to be something I could tolerate for long. I hadn’t satisfied my eye for style, and I didn’t like the way my work was presented. With this site I have scratched both those itches. With the subtle sci-fi look, and the way users are able to interact with the content, I feel I’ve created something I can be happy with for years to come. There will be updates, but I feel I’ve got the core of it right and my confidence as a designer has sky-rocketed."

        "I started my working life in the service industry working in restaurants and hotels. These are often high stress environments where a mixture of multi-tasking and interpersonal skills are crucial. I made a lot of friends, had a lot of fun, and took a lot of ass-whoopings. Wouldn’t trade this experience for anything.",
        "After the service industry I moved into the medical cannabis industry where I worked in a call centre. I found myself at this strange intersection between law, medicine, and customer service. Many of our patients were suffering live on the phone while I worked to untangle them from regulatory snags and get them the relief they needed (and not necessarily being appreciated for my efforts). This job required empathy, patience, conflict resolution skills, and high-level communication. I took my work seriously and was promoted to Call Quality Assurance Lead. In this role I was responsible for monitoring the quality of our customer service and working with our reps to iron out kinks in their approach. I decided that one-on-one coaching and slaps on the wrist were insufficient to ensure great service so I started hosting by-monthly meetings where the staff and I discussed difficult calls and brainstormed ways to get through them. These meetings were very popular not just because of their educational value, but I suspect that there was therapeutic value in having management acknowledge our reps’ pain points on a regular basis.",
        "Currently I’m working as a freelance front-end developer and AI specialist. Freelancing requires a level of accountability I haven’t experienced previously, but I’m well up to the task and am thoroughly enjoying charting my own course."

This course gave me the foundation and the confidence to continue my education on my own. Since then I’ve built an NPM package, a PiPI package, and various websites for clients. This course opened up software engineering for me in a way that has allowed me to follow my nose and grow my love for this kind of work.",
        "In 2019 I completed a First Aid Course. Working through the drills and exercises necessary to prepare one for a first responder role was an excellent meditation on the importance of decisiveness and responsibility.",
        "In 2016 I completed three introductory Journalism courses at BCIT. I came away from this experience with one major and invaluable lesson: asking questions is a skill. The better you’re able to formulate intelligent questions, the better the quality of information you’ll receive and the better positioned you’ll be to move forward.",
        "In 2014 I earned a CELTA certificate. CELTA is a qualification for teaching English as a foreign language. The course was very hands-on and had me teaching real students within a week. One of the most useful things I learned in this course was teaching something by teaching what it is not. Here’s an example: I teach you that a pen is a writing instrument that uses ink. Then I show you a pencil. Is this a pen? No. Then I show you a paint brush. Is this a pen? No. This example may sound obvious but the technique scales up and is invaluable in ensuring that people understand you.",
